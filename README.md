Project: Investigate a Dataset - The Movie Database movie data

### Date created
3rd July, 2022

### Project Title
Investigating a Dataset - The Movie Database movie data

### Description
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including their release date, budget, revenue generated, user vote counts, etc. Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

### Background
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

This is a great place to start digging into those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.

In this presentation, based on this dataset various questions will be answered for the curious minds. For example:

- Which genres are most popular from year to year?
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
- who are the most famous actors?
- Movie genres, how did they change all over the years?
- What about the revenues, budget and movie popularity, do they correlate with each other?

### What Software Do I use?
What Software Do I Use?
To complete the project, the following software requirements are applied:
    1. Google Colaboratory, Python3, Numpy, and Pandas installed using Anaconda
    2. A text editor e.g., Sublime or Atom
    3. A terminal application (Git Bash)


Generally, at the end of the project, I make use of Version Control. I used my local Git repository and my GitHub repository. Create a repository, work on files, stage files, and commit them to GitHub. I also demonstrated how to hide files using .gitignore files.
I learned important tools that all programmers use. First, I got an introduction to working in the terminal. Next, I learned to use git and GitHub to manage versions of a program and collaborate with others on programming projects. I add a completed project on GitHub, work with branches, edit a README file and project files, merge branches, and stage and commit my changes to my project GitHub repository.


### Files used
